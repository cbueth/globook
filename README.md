# Globook

Repository for the Globook project holding the source code for the web application and
the Globook API.

## Idea

The idea of this project is a place to track hitchhiking books - books that are
passed from person to person. Knowing where a book has travelled might be motivating
for the reader to keep reading and passing it on.

When a book starts its journey, the donator writes a welcoming message with a short
explanation of Globook into the first page of the book. This will include the unique
identifier and the secret. The donator can also write a short message into the book.
Online, the donator registers the book with general information about the book, like
title and author. The donator can also register a location where the book is currently
located.

Identifications are made using a unique identifier and a secret. The unique identifier
is used to identify the book, the secret is used to make sure only a person who
has the book can register a new location.

## Central functionality

- Overview Map
    - Display all books on a map with current location.
    - Click on a book to display the book view.
- Book View
    - Display all catches for a book.
    - Click on a location to display the catch details.
    - Add a new catch.
- Search
    - Search for books by title, author, or unique identifier.
    - Display the search results on a map.
- Add a new book
    - Register a new book with title, author, unique identifier, and secret.
    - Show an example of a welcome message to be written into the book.
- Location Picker
    - Select a location on a map and radius for security.

## Terminology

- **Book**: A book that is registered with Globook.
    - **Title**: The title of the book.
    - **Author**: The author of the book.
    - **Message**: A message written by the donator to be displayed online.
    - **Unique identifier**: A unique identifier for the book.
    - **Secret**: A secret for the book, used as a password for registering.
- **Donator**: The person who donates a book to Globook.
- **Reader**: The person who reads a book and passes it on to another person.
- **User**: Either a donator or a reader. Collect IP addresses and other information
  about the user? No registration wanted.
- **Catch**: A catch is the act of registering a new location for a book.
    - **Location**: The location of the catch
    - **Radius**: The radius of the location. No exact location wanted.
    - **Message**: A message written by the reader.
    - **Date**: The date of the catch.
- **Logbook**: Database table holding all catches for all books.

## Web application

The application is a one-page web application with Flask and Leaflet that allows a
user to register a location of a physical object, especially a book, by clicking on
a map and entering the unique identifier and secret.

### Setup

The _quickest_ way would be to use the Docker image. A docker image would set up
the environment and run the application. We don't have a Docker image. ðŸ¤·
A _quick_ way is to use conda to create an environment and install the requirements as
follows:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate globook
```

In the case that conda is not able to resolve the environment, the requirements can be
installed manually:

```bash
conda create -y --name globook -c conda-forge python=3.11 flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-restful flask-cors
conda activate globook
```

To remove the environment run:

```bash
conda deactivate
conda remove --name globook --all
```

### Further ideas

- Don't show all books on the overview map.
    - Closest books to the user's location.
    - Books that have been caught recently.
    - Books that have been caught far away.
    - Books that have travelled a long distance.
    - Random books.

### Not TODO list

Feel free to implement any of these ideas.

- [ ] Registration of users.
- [ ] Email notification system for new catches of a book.
- [ ] Add a QR code to the book, linking to the book's page on Globook. Who would
  want to glue a QR code into a book? Certainly not me.
- [ ] Docker image. ðŸ¤·
